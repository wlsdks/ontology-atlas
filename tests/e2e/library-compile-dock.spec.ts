/**
 * **Compile opens a dock a person can see.**
 *
 * Measured in the installed app on 2026-09-05: the Compile chip rendered enabled with
 * four sources waiting, and pressing it — pointer twice, then keyboard with the focus
 * ring visible — changed nothing on screen. The handler ran; the dock was in the DOM.
 * It had been placed after the layout row, inside the page's flex **column**, and its
 * surface is `absolute inset-y-3 right-3`, so the frame collapsed to zero height and its
 * own `overflow-hidden` finished the job. A press that does nothing is the worst possible
 * report, because nothing about it says whether the product is broken or the person is.
 *
 * The regression is **geometry**, so this spec measures geometry: the dock must be
 * visible, hold a real rect, and sit inside the same row as `<main>` rather than below
 * it. A `toBeVisible()` alone would have passed on the broken build — `visible` in
 * Playwright means a non-empty bounding box, which the zero-height frame technically had
 * once its inner surface painted, and it is the frame that has to have the height.
 *
 * **Why the desktop bridge is stubbed in a browser.** The app is a WKWebView running this
 * same static export, so injecting the runtime signal exercises exactly this render
 * boundary — the same reasoning `desktop-shell-rail.spec.ts` records. What stays with
 * installed-app measurement is everything downstream of the dock: the real adapter
 * launch, the turn, and the writes.
 *
 * The brief's own content is not asserted here. `compile-brief.test.ts` pins all six
 * rules and the verbatim template against the schema module; this spec proves the press
 * reaches the dock carrying a `compile` request, which is the link that was missing.
